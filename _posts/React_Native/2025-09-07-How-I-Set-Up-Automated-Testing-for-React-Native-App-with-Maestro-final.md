In the first two posts, I explained why we chose Maestro and how I set up the test environments for both Android and iOS. In this final part, I‚Äôll show how I built the **reporting and collaboration system** around Maestro tests, how it fits into our daily workflow, and what I learned through the process.

## Building a Complete Automated Testing Structure

The testing itself is only half the story. For automation to be effective, the **results need to be visible and actionable**. Otherwise, QA teams won‚Äôt know what failed, and developers won‚Äôt have enough context to fix issues quickly.

Here‚Äôs the structure I implemented:

```
GitHub Action ‚Üí Maestro ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí GitHub Action ‚Üí Slack + GitHub Issues
```

* **Maestro** runs the actual tests.
* **S3** stores screenshots and logs when failures occur.
* **GitHub Actions** orchestrates the pipeline and generates reports.
* **Slack + GitHub Issues** distribute results so the whole team stays in the loop.

This flow ensures that failures are never hidden‚Äîthey‚Äôre documented, traceable, and easy to reproduce.

## Reporting Results in Practice

The reporting workflow looks like this:

1. **Build artifacts** (`.apk` and `.app`) for Android and iOS.
2. **Trigger GitHub Action** whenever new server code is pushed.
3. **Run Maestro tests** across emulators and simulators.
4. **Export results**: debug logs, screenshots, and test summaries.
5. **Upload artifacts to S3** with public links.
6. **Create GitHub Issues** automatically for failed tests, including S3 links and screenshots.
7. **Generate an HTML report** for a human-friendly summary.
8. **Post results to Slack**, so QA and devs get notified instantly.

For example, when a test fails, the Slack message looks something like:

* ‚ùå Test: *Login Flow*
* Screenshot: \[S3 link]
* Logs: \[S3 link]
* GitHub Issue: \[link]

This way, no one needs to dig through CI logs manually‚Äîeverything is one click away.

## Collaboration Benefits

Automated testing is not just about saving developer time. It‚Äôs also about **improving collaboration between teams**:

* **QA** doesn‚Äôt have to repeat the same manual tests for old client. Instead, they can focus on exploratory testing and edge cases.
* **Developers** get immediate context (logs + screenshots) when something breaks, making debugging faster.
* **Managers/PMs** can track test coverage and failures via GitHub Issues without asking developers for updates.

In other words, the automation system became a **shared source of truth** for the entire team.

## Challenges and Limitations

Of course, setting this up wasn‚Äôt without challenges:

* **Performance constraints**: Our GitHub Action runners were not powerful enough for parallel testing. Everything runs sequentially, which increases build times.
* **iOS quirks**: Accessibility grouping in iOS required a custom Babel plugin to work around (as I covered in Part 1).
* **Maintenance overhead**: As the app grows, test scripts also grow, which means they need continuous refactoring and review.
* **Updating scripts for each release**: Whenever a new version is released, old scripts may fail because of changed text or added features. This requires the QA team to continually update and maintain the scripts to keep tests reliable.

Despite these, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Even a limited automation setup already reduced repetitive manual testing by a huge margin.

## What I Want to Add Next

This project is still evolving, and there‚Äôs a lot more I‚Äôd like to explore:

* **Parallel testing** with stronger runners or Maestro Cloud.
* **RTL (Right-to-Left) language support** for full internationalization testing.
* **Deeper integration with analytics**‚Äîfor example, tracking failure trends over time.
* **Better reporting dashboards**, perhaps combining Maestro outputs with visualization tools.

Automation should always grow with the app itself, and I see this system as a foundation to build upon.

## Lessons Learned

Looking back, here are the key takeaways from this journey:

1. **Start small, then iterate** ‚Äì don‚Äôt try to automate everything at once. Begin with the most repetitive flows.
2. **Make results visible** ‚Äì automation is only useful if the whole team can access the outputs easily.
3. **Collaborate early with QA** ‚Äì test coverage is most effective when QA and devs design it together.
4. **Don‚Äôt underestimate infra** ‚Äì weak machines or missing setups can become bottlenecks.

Setting up Maestro for our React Native app was not just a technical exercise; it changed how our team thinks about testing. Instead of dreading repetitive checks, we now see automated testing as a **safety net** that lets us move faster and release more confidently.

üëâ That‚Äôs the end of this series! If you‚Äôve tried Maestro or built a similar pipeline, I‚Äôd love to hear how you approached reporting, collaboration, or scaling tests further.
